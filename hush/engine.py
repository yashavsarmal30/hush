"""OpenVINO Whisper engine: model load/download management + dictation sessions.

Chosen over faster-whisper and whisper.cpp after benchmarking on this machine
(i7-1360P, no CUDA): OpenVINO int8 CPU runs whisper base.en at <1s for a 4s
utterance vs ~6s for ctranslate2 int8 — see tests/bench_*.py and PROGRESS.md.

A DictationSession transcribes incrementally while recording (committing chunks
at silence boundaries) so that when the user releases the hotkey only the tail
remains — keeping end-of-utterance latency low even for long dictations.

# Which models are worth handing to the iGPU. Measured, not assumed — on this class
# of machine (i7-1360P + Iris Xe, tests/bench_accel.py, 4.4 s clip):
#
#   large-v3-turbo   CPU 8.02 s   GPU 2.12 s   -> GPU wins decisively
#   small            CPU 1.49 s   GPU 1.31 s   -> a wash, and the GPU LOSES on
#                                                 longer clips (2.63 vs 2.27 s)
#
# End to end through the app (hotkey release -> text) the turbo win is 4.60 s -> 1.79 s
# warm, i.e. ~2.6x rather than the ~3.8x those raw generate() numbers imply — the
# engine caps max_new_tokens by clip length and the bench does not. Same text either
# way: tests/eval_device_accuracy.py scores CER 15.3% on both devices.
#
# The split is architectural rather than incidental. large-v3-turbo is ~79% encoder
# (32 encoder layers vs 4 decoder — that is the "turbo" design), and Whisper's
# encoder is one fixed-size, fully parallel pass over a 30 s mel regardless of how
# long you actually spoke: on CPU it costs a flat ~8 s for a 4 s clip and a 14 s one
# alike. That shape — big, dense, parallel, no autoregression — is what an iGPU is
# for. Small models spend their time in the memory-bound decoder loop instead, where
# the GPU has nothing to add and per-call overhead makes it a net loss. So this stays
# a per-model list, not a blanket "use the GPU if you have one".
